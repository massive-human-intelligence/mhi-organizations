# Constitution

A constitution defines the organizational form, the rules of participation, and the foundational principles and long-term goals of the organization.

Consider making this a series of numbered "articles" that reflect and express the evolving form, [[Purpose]], and understanding of principles of the organization over time.

See [[Sample Constitution - Dawn of Everything Book Circle]].
