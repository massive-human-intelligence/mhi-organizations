# Participation

Organizations are formed of Members who participate in the thinking and doing of the organization.

There are rules of participation that can be defined informally or formally. Formal definitions of _all_ aspects of participation are impractical, as there are too many subtleties and combinations of situations to define them all.

A high-functioning organization will therefore have a foundational set of rules of participation; a process for adjudicating conflicts; and a way to evolve the rules to work more effectively.

Organizational health and effectiveness can be significantly improved or degraded based on how well these processes run, and whether they are more or less "fair".
