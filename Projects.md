# Projects

Projects are generally time-limited sets of organized activities intended to achieve particular goals. Organizations have a fractal, hierarchical set of Projects that accomplish work that accrues to the organization's stated [[Purpose]] and Commitments. 

Goals, organization, and activities may be defined more or less formally. There may also be tacit understandings internally and externally that enhance or degrade the project's progress and efficiency.

Projects are similar to organizations in that they have a Purpose, but they are _not_ autonomous; they are managed and regulated by the organization in which they are situated.

Projects are internal to an organization, but they have Inputs, Outputs, and Status that may be reported or connected to other Projects in other organizations.

A template for managing projects is given in [[Everything Is A Project]].
