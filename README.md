# Organizations the MHIP Way

**Comments welcome!** Click the "**<**" icon in the upper right of the page to annotate/comment with [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/).

**Organizations the MHIP Way** describes patterns, processes, and tools that help independent and autonomous people organize and form independent and autonomous organizations.

Organizations the MHIP Way is part of the [Massive Human Intelligence Project](https://massivehumanintelligence.org/), which is organized by [Peter Kaminski](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).

## Purpose of Organizations

Organizations exist to accomplish things that individuals cannot. Like living organisms, they can sense, learn, grow, and die.

Organizations define their boundaries by creating formal or informal rules of [[Participation]]. They work with individuals and other organizations through formal and informal agreements.

An organization decides how it will define itself and what it will do through processes of [[Governance]], which includes  formal and informal internal agreements, with both explicit and tacit components.

To accomplish things, organizations use [[Projects]] and [[Processes]].

## How to Create an Organization

Some typical steps:

- A couple of people in conversation realize that there is a latent organization that could come together. (Or, one person wants to accomplish more than they can alone, and start a "Stone Soup" process of convincing others to realize there could be an organization...)
- A locus of organization and communication is formed -- a good and descriptive name; and perhaps a chat channel, and a shared document folder. These tools externalize and preserve the conversations about forming an organization, and allow others to peruse and participate in the conversations as they decide whether they might be interested in joining.
- The bootstrap cycles of defining what the organization will be, and how people will participate, are started.

To get off the ground, organizations start with a repeated bootstrap cycle, defining what the organization will do, and how its members will participate. The outcome of the cycles is emergent, because each side of the organization-participation equation is hugely defined by the other side of the equation.  What the organization can do is defined by what its participants are interested and willing to do; and the interest and willingness of the members to participate is shaped by what the organization wants to do, and how it wants to do it.

This phase is marked by negotiation between confirmed participants and potential participants, as they work together to define both sides of the equation to everyone's satisfaction.

As the organization starts to shape up, it creates a [[Constitution]], which defines the organizational form, the rules of participation, and the foundational principles and long-term goals of the organization.

## How to Operate an Organization

TBD

There will be sections about [[Projects]] and [[Processes]].

## Organizational Lifecycle

This is a semi-ordered list of some of the phases of an organization's existence. It is not meant to be a straight-line chronology, rather a compilation of various phases, roughly in order of when they might occur.  Loops of various fractal scales will occur, and not all organizations will necessarily have all these phases.

- idea or vision
- coalescing, defining itself
- launch
- growing and evolving
- steady-state
- decline
- rebirth
- senescence
- dissolution
