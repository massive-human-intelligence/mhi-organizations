## DoE Book Circle, Organizational Article 1 - DRAFT

(This document is a DRAFT - please comment and edit! Make it something you believe in and co-own and are proud of. :-)

## How We Work Together

Our **organizational form** is an informal club. Anyone may join meetings and communication channels. Everybody is expected to conduct themselves within the social norms of the group.

Our **core communication channels** are the CSC Mattermost channel [Dawn of Everything](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/dawn-of-everything), and Zoom calls every other week (schedule TBD). Zoom calls will have a clear agenda and expected outcomes, prepared a week or so in advance. Everybody in the group has responsibility and authority to make sure agendas are created and that our meetings are productive.

We will cover both the book chapters in sequential order, and other topics of interest as they arise. See the "Primary Goals and Anti-Goals" section below for more detail about what we hope to accomplish.

We work in the open. As we create information artifacts, they are published with this license and disclaimer:

> This [information artifact] is collectively authored by the Dawn of Everything Book Circle participants, and is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (CC-BY 4.0), with the disclaimer that the views and opinions expressed herein are part of an unfinished, informal conversation, and that they do not necessarily reflect consensus nor the opinions or beliefs of any particular person in the group.

We have a wiki website, [Dawn of Everything Book Circle](https://doe.bookcircle.academy). The website hosts meeting notes and additional materials, forming a "group brain" and active memory for us. Please make comments and suggested edits on the website using [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/). Any club member may participate in wiki editing, check with Pete or Bill for more details.

We use Google Docs to co-create **"Organizational Articles"**. Organizational Articles are written and commented upon during a "draft" phase, edited to improve, and are then ratified by the group. We ratify by coming to [rough consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus) that the document is complete and good, perhaps aided by inclusion of a dissent section. When ratified, the document is moved to the wiki website.

## Primary Goals and Anti-Goals

- Enable participation by anyone who is sincerely interested to participate, regardless of race, ethnicity, age, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, ability, economic status, or geographic location.
- To acknowledge and attempt to account for this book circle taking place in the context of a global pandemic that has first and second order cognitive impacts. These impacts hit  our individual and collective ability to make sense of things.
    - From COVID-19 infection and Long Covid: brain fog and fatigue are likely impacts
    - From the long emergency of the pandemic: cognitive exhaustion and overwhelm
-   Ensure that everyone who participates, at whatever level, feels like they are getting value and gain knowledge and understanding because of their participation.
-   It is not necessary to attend each meeting or participate in all communication channels.
-   It is not necessary to have read chapters or the entire book before participating, although it is expected that you will participate in the topics currently being covered, including topics from the chapters of the book.
-   To have fun, learn, and enjoy each others' company.
-   Work productively, with a fairly high level of organization, co-facilitation, and use of tools for thought.
-   Uncover "Big Questions" that relate to The Dawn of Everything. We believe that big questions are better than fixed conclusions.
-   Anti-goal: To march through and "finish" the book quickly and without depth.
-   Anti-goal: To generate a consensus on what a passage or idea ‘means’.
-   what else?
